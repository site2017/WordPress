Actually, I've got no Title displayed and no upload "+" button on the right.
\views\category\tmpl\default_head.php is not parsed at all, when a category has nothing in it.

Currently, I have to go elsewhere (upper category) to upload in frontend.
Anyone to confirm title and "+" are missing?

Ideas for a fix? From where default_head.php is fired?
